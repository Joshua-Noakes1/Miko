Docker based Minecraft server hosted within Github Codespaces

## Prerequisites

To access the server I recomend using [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) or [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) with this repo using the official [Tailscale Dev-Container](https://github.com/tailscale/codespace).
To configure Tailscale follow the instructions within the Tailscale Dev-Container [README](xxx).

## Usage

The ```setup.sh``` will unzip your ```data.zip``` into the ```data.zip``` folder and it will then start the server, you can then connect to the server using the Tailscale IP address of the server and port 25565.
