## Prerequisites

To configure Tailscale follow the instructions within the Tailscale Dev-Container [README](https://github.com/tailscale/codespace).

## Usage

The Docker container is configured to use [itgz's docker-minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) as the Minecraft server, more info on how the server can be configured can be found [here](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server/blob/master/README.md).
